# BraveTools

Functionality:
This project was made to handle a couple of issues in game that become time consuming, these include: Gear checking for abilities, bags and gear sets

It works by scanning the packets recieved from the game server, decrypting them and then reading the data. This data is then sent to an external server,
from that server it is parsed and checked against a database and returned
